## ðŸ“˜ Introduction

I've never been an Apple or Mac person.  From the very beginning, I've been a hardcore PC Junkie running the latest version of Windows and I've made absolutely no apologies whatsoever for doing so.  Oh sure, I went through my wanker phase when I hit university after the Army (mid-1990's) and installed Linux a couple of times and actually stuck with it for a few hours until I realised I couldn't get my favourite games to run - but never fear, I was just as much a hypocrite as the rest of them while slagging off Bill Gates and his corporate monolith which stood poised to dominate computing to its utter ruin ... or so we feared back then.

If you haven't been an avid Windows user over the past few years, you _may_ have missed a trend which, I must admit, initially stunned me when I first realized the extent of it all.  Microsoft - rather than betraying us all and locking the world into their own particularly sadistic brand of proprietary technologies forever, have for several years now been one of the most benevolent champions of open-source technology and have put their money where their mouth is in a big way.

Not only do they own [GitHub](https://github.com) (the world's largest repository of open-source software) and host repositories for the greatest and lowliest of software developers alike from all over the globe - and they do so for the vast majority of us absolutely free of charge.  You can see their true colors expressed in the WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and the WSA (Windows Subsystem for Android) which is due for release to the wider market early in 2023.  They're literally banking the foundation of their core product offering - the Windows Operating System - on a proprietary version of Linux they call [CBL-Mariner](https://www.xda-developers.com/boot-cbl-mariner-microsoft-linux-distribution/).

I can tell you that from the perspective of a professional software engineer who spent the majority of their career writing software intended to be run on some form of device running some incarnation of Linux or another on a PC running Windows, the advent of the WSL was the thing I had most longed for my entire career without ever realising it.

My Windows PC is a tool that I finally feel is starting to exceed my expectations rather than constrain them, and the WSL is a big part of the reason for that.  As a development tool, my Windows PC feels as though it is capable of everything I want from it and more in a way that seems evermore effortless with each new version they release into my eager hands via an unattended update tool that also seems infinitely more capable than its predecessors (that I used to engage with apprehension and speak of with derision).

I'm think I'm going to _actually_ say it ... Microsoft have become - in my opinion - the leaders by example in the industry that we were all convinced they could never be.  In fact, my relationship with the company has grown from one of begrudging tolerance into true admiration.  It's almost as though they stopped _promising_ to make my life easier by virtue of their products and either by some miracle or diabolic contract all of a sudden started to actually deliver.

Which is just one of the reasons I decided to start working on this project to show how quite an average Windows PC could be turned into a world-class cloud hosting appliance with very little effort (on your end of the stick anyway), and for next to no cost.  Another is my hope to convey my appreciation of how the humble personal computer has come of age in a BIG way - especially if it's running Windows and WSL2.
