Swarm-Kit Documentation

v0.1.0

</h1>

## üëÄ Overview

This collection of how-to documents and scripts will walk you through the process of setting up your very own, self-hosted, high-availability server infrastructure that - whether you do it as a hobby or in order to support your online business - will potentially save you hundreds if not _thousands_ of dollars each month in service subscriptions.

This project will show you:

- How to setup and maintain your own local 'cluster'
- How to securely access your home-based services via the internet
- How to install dozens of top-rated open-source applications
- How to containerise your own applications
- And much more!

## üìñ Table of Contents

- [**Chapter 1 - Setting Up Your Cluster**](1-Cluster.md)
  - [Setup WSL (Ubuntu)](wsl-init.md)
  - [Setup Virtual Machines (Ubuntu)](vm-init.md)

## üìò Introduction

Initially you'll see that this guide is written from the perspective of a Windows (10 or 11) user, but the majority of the action happens in Linux which can be run by literally _anyone_ without great difficulty or expense.  If you're not using Windows, you can probably skip the whole first chapter and jump right into the second - and you'll notice that I don't spend a whole lot of time at all discussing how to actually get to the point where you're installing Ubuntu on your virtual machines.  This is because there are a whole bunch of different ways to achieve this step, and how you get to this point is largely up to personal preference.  `Swarm-Kit` is really about what happens once you've got your virtualisation platform sorted out.

### How will this benefit you?

Even though we've had the benefit of container technologies for a few years now, I feel their full potential is not yet being exploited.  I hope that by making this guide available, I can help more people realise the fantastic resource that container technologies offer, and make them a little less scary and a little more available for those of you who don't have a lot of experience working with them.  The truth is that _every_ business can benefit from containerisation, and the impact they will have on your bottom line is not to be underestimated.

### Who am I?

I'm Darren - and I use the nickname "Ragdata" online.

At university I studied Machine Learning, and for the past 25 years I've worked as a software engineer exclusively using online technologies.  My first job out of university was helping to build the world's first content management system with integrated e-commerce capabilities at a time when even the banks in Australia weren't able to provide online payment services to local businesses.  I produced Australia's first-ever grocery shopping website in conjunction with GDM Wholesalers at the Rocklea Markets in Brisbane before Mark Zuckerberg had launched his "face-thing" site and while the Googlers were still working out of their garage.  Here in the background I helped to define the way that the world does business today, and I want to help more of you get your heads around the way we'll be powering the way we do business tomorrow.
