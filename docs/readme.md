Swarm-Kit Documentation

v0.1.0

</h1>

<h3 align="center"><a href="https://github.com/aevernet/swarm-kit/blob/master/docs/0-Index.md">Documentation Index</a></h3>

## ‚≠ê Overview

This project is destined to be a **MONSTER** which gives you:

- **Detailed Documentation** <br /> Installable and detailed documentation giving step-by-step instructions and code blocks for each and every task required to build yourself a reliable, secure, self-hosted Docker Swarm Cluster packed with world-class services.
  <br /><br />
- **Management & Utility Scripts Galore** <br /> If you don't want to burden yourself by reading the documentation and doing everything yourself, you can find a script you can execute with a single command which will take care of everything for you in seconds!
  <br /><br />
- **An Extensive Services Catalogue** <br /> Packed with the best-of-the-best open-source solutions you can use to replace almost ANY SaaS product you're currently paying a monthly subscription for.  This is a game-changer for small-businesses and hobbyists alike!
  <br /><br />
- **Accessible 24 / 7 Regardless of Where You Are** <br /> The secret weapon `Swarm-Kit` provides is the fact that I'll not only show you how to set this up at home, I'll show you how to make any of your self-hosted services available from the Internet so that you can access them no matter where you are.  The best part is that the method used in this project is secure, easy to set up and manage, and completely FREE of charge!

## üìò Introduction

Initially you'll see that this guide is written from the perspective of a Windows (10 or 11) user, but the majority of the action happens in Linux which can be run by literally _anyone_ without great difficulty or expense.  If you're not using Windows, you can probably skip the whole first chapter and jump right into the second - and you'll notice that I don't spend a whole lot of time at all discussing how to actually get to the point where you're installing Ubuntu on your virtual machines.  This is because there are a whole bunch of different ways to achieve this step, and how you get to this point is largely up to personal preference.  `Swarm-Kit` is really about what happens once you've got your virtualisation platform sorted out.

### How will this benefit you?

Even though we've had the benefit of container technologies for a few years now, I feel their full potential is not yet being exploited.  I hope that by making this guide available, I can help more people realise the fantastic resource that container technologies offer, and make them a little less scary and a little more available for those of you who don't have a lot of experience working with them.  The truth is that _every_ business can benefit from containerisation, and the impact they will have on your bottom line is not to be underestimated.

### Who am I?

I'm Darren - and I use the nickname "Ragdata" online.

At university I studied Machine Learning, and for the past 25 years I've worked as a software engineer exclusively using online technologies.  My first job out of university was helping to build the world's first content management system with integrated e-commerce capabilities at a time when even the banks in Australia weren't able to provide online payment services to local businesses.  I produced Australia's first-ever grocery shopping website in conjunction with GDM Wholesalers at the Rocklea Markets in Brisbane before Mark Zuckerberg had launched his "face-thing" site and while the Googlers were still working out of their garage.  Here in the background I helped to define the way that the world does business today, and I want to help more of you get your heads around the way we'll be powering the way we do business tomorrow.
