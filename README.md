## ‚≠ê Project Overview

This project is destined to be a **MONSTER** which gives you:

- **Detailed Documentation** <br /> Installable and detailed documentation giving step-by-step instructions and code blocks for each and every task required to build yourself a reliable, secure, self-hosted Docker Swarm Cluster packed with world-class services.
<br /><br />
- **Management & Utility Scripts Galore** <br /> If you don't want to burden yourself by reading the documentation and doing everything yourself, you can find a script you can execute with a single command which will take care of everything for you in seconds!
<br /><br />
- **An Extensive Services Catalogue** <br /> Packed with the best-of-the-best open-source solutions you can use to replace almost ANY SaaS product you're currently paying a monthly subscription for.  This is a game-changer for small-businesses and hobbyists alike!
<br /><br />
- **Accessible 24 / 7 Regardless of Where You Are** <br /> The secret weapon `Swarm Kit` provides is the fact that I'll not only show you how to set this up at home, I'll show you how to make any of your self-hosted services available from the Internet so that you can access them no matter where you are.  The best part is that the method used in this project is secure, easy to set up and manage, and completely FREE of charge!

## üìÇ Installation

### Step 1 - Clone the Repository

Because this repository contains submodules this may trip some people up - but it's very easy to make sure everything arrives as it should:

First, clone this repository as usual:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:ragdata/swarm-kit
```

Then, initialise the submodule:

```shell
git submodule init
```

And finally, update the submodule

```shell
git submodule update
```

### Step 2 - Configure & Install Swarm Kit

Configuring and installing `Swarm Kit` is just as easy:

```shell
sudo ./sk-config

cd src/etc

sudo ./swarm-kit -i
```

And that's it!  `Swarm Kit` is installed along with `Bash Bits` which is the **Modular Bash Library** I maintain and it's included with this project because I like to put my money where my mouth is by using my own tools! This project is an extensive project written almost entirely in Bash script - I'm not sure it would have been possible for me to do without Bash Bits. If you'd like to find out more about Bash Bits, access documentation / raise an issue / etc, you can do so at the [**`Bash Bits` GitHub Repository**](https://github.com/ragdata/bash-bits)

### HERE is where the fun really starts ...

`Swarm Kit` is a large project with a lot of moving parts.  Therefore, one of the most important parts of this project is its [Documentation](docs/readme.md).  There are 2 ways you can approach installing `Swarm Kit`:

1. **Manually**
    - Installing `Swarm Kit` manually is not for the feint of heart.  This is recommended ONLY if you are confident that you know what you're doing, AND you think you might want to make some changes along the way.
    - To install `Swarm Kit` manually, head to the [project documentation](docs/readme.md) and start reading ... and be prepared to do a LOT of it ...


2. **Automagically**
    - `Swarm Kit` ships with a host of scripts to help you get your own self-hosted Docker Swarm Cluster up and running in no time flat!  Even if you're a seasoned developer, I'm confident that you'll be able to find something among these worth your while.
    - To install `Swarm Kit` automatically, you still need to head to the [project documentation](docs/readme.md), but I can promise that you're going to do a LOT less reading that if you had chosen to install manually.
