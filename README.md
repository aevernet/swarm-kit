## üëÄ Overview

This collection of how-to documents and scripts will walk you through the process of setting up your very own, self-hosted, high-availability server infrastructure that - whether you do it as a hobby or in order to support your online business - will potentially save you hundreds if not _thousands_ of dollars each month in service subscriptions.

This project will show you:

- How to setup and maintain your own local 'cluster'
- How to securely access your home-based services via the internet
- How to install dozens of top-rated open-source applications
- How to containerise your own applications
- And how to do it all WITHOUT spending a fortune on hardware!
  - (You could start with as little as a single Raspberry Pi (model 4) and an external hard drive if you wanted to)!

## üìÇ Installation

`Swarm-Kit` is a large project with a lot of moving parts.  Therefore, one of the most important parts of this project is its [Documentation](docs/readme.md).  There are 2 ways you can approach installing `Swarm-Kit`:

1. **Manually**
    - Installing `Swarm-Kit` manually is not for the feint of heart.  This is recommended ONLY if you are confident that you know what you're doing, AND you think you might want to make some changes along the way.
    - To install `Swarm-Kit` manually, head to the [project documentation](docs/readme.md) and start reading ... and be prepared to do a LOT of it ...


2. **Automagically**
    - `Swarm-Kit` ships with a host of scripts to help you get your own self-hosted Docker Swarm Cluster up and running in no time flat!  Even if you're a seasoned developer, I'm confident that you'll be able to find something among these worth your while.
    - To install `Swarm-Kit` automatically, you still need to head to the [project documentation](docs/readme.md), but I can promise that you're going to do a LOT less reading that if you had chosen to install manually.

## ‚ùì What's Included?

In the simplest terms, `Swarm-Kit` consists of:

- [**A butt-load of documentation**](docs/readme.md) which could ultimately teach you quite a lot about building and managing your own self-hosted services


- A selection of [**Utility Scripts**](src/bin) which will help you set up and configure your cluster.  Most of these you can access and control using NPM - or you can access them from the Bash command line like they did in the olden days ...


- A collection of [**Cluster Management Scripts**](src/scripts) which will help to keep you sane.  They'll also make the job of managing your cluster a whole lot easier.


- A [**Services Catalogue**](src/stacks) which is what you _actually_ came here for.  These little beauties are ready-to-go, tried and tested `docker-compose` scripts which will allow you to deploy just about any service you could image - from Media and Game Servers, Backup Managers, and Password Vaults to Image Galleries, URL Shorteners, Website Builders and Analytics Packages - the `Swarm-Kit` Services Catalogue contains a curated selection of the BEST OF THE BEST open-source software solutions which, when used properly, could potentially save you HUNDREDS if not THOUSANDS of dollars per month in SaaS and Service Subscription Fees.  An absolute MUST-HAVE if you run a business which relies heavily on the internet (and there are _very_ few which don't).

`Swarm-Kit` will even show you how to make your self-hosted services available to the Internet SAFELY, SECURELY, and WITHOUT having to deal with port forwarding on your home router (goodbye website hosting fees)!  Even if you're only interested in self-hosting as a hobby, the money you can save by not having to pay for services such as Spotify Premium, Scribd, and many others could be quite substantial!
