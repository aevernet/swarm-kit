## üëÄ Overview

This collection of how-to documents and scripts will walk you through the process of setting up your very own, self-hosted, high-availability server infrastructure that - whether you do it as a hobby or in order to support your online business - will potentially save you hundreds if not _thousands_ of dollars each month in service subscriptions.

This project will show you:

- How to setup and maintain your own local 'cluster'
- How to securely access your home-based services via the internet
- How to install dozens of top-rated open-source applications
- How to containerise your own applications
- And much more!
